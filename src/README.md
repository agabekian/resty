There are two main reasons why the DELETE functionality might work now with the provided code changes:

Correct Header Handling:

The original code might have been including a Content-Type header even for DELETE requests. This could potentially cause issues depending on the server-side implementation.
The updated code sets the Content-Type header only for POST and PUT requests, which is the standard behavior as DELETE requests typically don't require a body. This ensures the server receives the request correctly.
Optional DELETE Success Handling (Informational):

The updated code doesn't directly "fix" the DELETE functionality, but it adds an optional check to handle successful DELETE responses.
This check demonstrates that the DELETE request reached the server and was likely processed successfully. It doesn't necessarily guarantee that the resource was deleted on the server-side, but it's a good indicator.
